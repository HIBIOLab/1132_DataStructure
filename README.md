# Report Example

## Overview
This report template covers Labxx (課堂實作) and HWxx (分組作業), which include solving various programming problems and submitting the corresponding solutions. Below are the detailed instructions for each section.
Please don't try to cheat or use AI tools to generate your commits.
When the TA is scoring, the evaluation will not only depend on the correctness of your code but also on the integrity of your commits.

## Format Instructions

### Lab01 - LeetCode Problem
- **Task**: Complete the problem on LeetCode and submit the solution to GitHub. Name your repository `1132_DataStructure/Lab01/Lab01_Q1.cpp`.
- **Submission**: Include the code in the `Lab01-Q1 Program Section` of your report.
- **Comments**: Make sure to add comments to your code to explain your logic.
- **Important**: These comments must be based on your own understanding and cannot be generated using AI tools. The quality of comments will impact your evaluation.

### HW01 - 分組作業
- **Task**: Complete the problem assigned by the professor and submit the solution to GitHub. Name your repository `1132_DataStructure/HW01/HW01.cpp`.
- **Submission**: Include the code in each `Section` of your report. Use Pygments to color the code and format it in C++.
- **Comments**: Make sure to add comments to your code to explain your logic.
- **Important**: These comments must be based on your own understanding and cannot be generated using AI tools. The quality of comments will impact your evaluation.

## Submission Instructions
1. Include all your code for HW01, HW02, Lab01, Lab02, etc., in the appropriate sections of your report.
